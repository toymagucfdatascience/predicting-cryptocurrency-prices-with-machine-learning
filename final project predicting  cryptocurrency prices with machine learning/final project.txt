predicting cryptocurrency prices  with machine learning.
Can we predict cryptocurrency prices using machine learning? We're going to build a Keras deep learning model that attemps to predict the future price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in this video. The type of model i'm using is a bidirectional LSTM recurrent network.
 Ethereum future prices as well as other cryptocurrency prices are hard to predict, but with the power of machine learning we can find a suitable prediction
 this project will build a model using machine learning to predicting bitcon for 2018 2017.
